ðŸ›’ Product Hub Store
This is a simple console-based e-commerce application built in Java. It simulates a product shopping system where users can browse products by category, add items to a shopping cart, and generate a final bill with applicable discounts. The project demonstrates core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.

âœ¨ Features
Product Catalog: Browse a variety of products organized into categories like Books, Garments, Mobiles, and TVs.

Shopping Cart: Add products and specify quantities to a shopping cart.

Dynamic Discounts: Discounts are automatically calculated based on the product type (e.g., specific discounts for Garments or TVs).

Bulk Purchase Discount: A special discount of 40% is applied to the final bill if the sub-total exceeds â‚¹50,000.

Duplicate Item Handling: If a user tries to add an item that is already in the cart, the system prompts them to update the quantity instead of adding a new entry.

Automated Bill Generation: A detailed bill is generated at checkout, showing line-item totals, discounts, sub-total, and the final amount.
